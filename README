LightAsync is:
	- A Java API
	- A way to utilize concurrent queues (Consumers & Producers)
	- Simple (at least meant to be!)
	- Lightweight
	- A maven project
	meant to be used:
		- On simple applications that needs async processing
		- On a local JVM, no remote stuff
	not:
		- A JMS implementation
		- A server
		- Complicated
		- A banana
		meant to be used:
			- On transactional environments
			- On clustered environments
			- As toilet paper

Thats it for now

Thx,
